# Pingshell-script-
a Bash script that pings all IP addresses in the 192.168.110.0/24 subnet and prompts you for the active and up ones:

Save the script to a file (e.g., ping_subnet.sh), make it executable (chmod +x ping_subnet.sh), and then run it (./ping_subnet.sh). It will ping each IP address in the specified subnet and display the active ones.

Remember to adjust the subnet and timeout values (-W 1) as needed for your network.

I have provided a Bash script that pings all IP addresses in the 192.168.110.0/24 subnet and prompts you for the active and up ones. If you need further assistance or have any specific requirements, feel free to ask
